# PARAZONES

Our innovative product is a oriented on building twin-building all around the world, that features a unique concept of parradox and order, designed to optimize the user experience through Web3, blockchain, and IOT technology. The building offers exciting and lively spaces, such as restaurants, a gym, a casino, bars, hotels, and spaces for businesses, while the order building has a more calm and organized atmosphere, with living apartments, conference halls, co-working spaces, and relaxing areas such as spas, massage rooms, and beauty salons.&#x20;

Our main goal is to provide an opportunity for investors to earn passive income by investing in the spaces within our buildings using cryptocurrency from all around the world. This innovative approach to real estate investment not only creates a new revenue stream for investors but also fosters a sense of community ownership and involvement.&#x20;

By using cryptocurrency, we are able to offer our investors a high level of security, transparency and efficiency, which is not possible with traditional investment methods. Investors can choose which spaces they want to invest in and they will receive a portion of the revenue generated by those spaces. This opens up the possibility for anyone to invest in real estate, regardless of their financial status or location.

&#x20;Additionally, as the buildings become more profitable over time, the value of the cryptocurrency used to invest in them will also increase, allowing investors to benefit from the growth of the overall ecosystem.&#x20;

Our commitment to the community goes beyond just providing passive income opportunities. We want to create a sense of ownership and involvement among our investors, so we will regularly provide updates and engage with them through various channels. We believe that this level of transparency and communication is essential for building a strong and sustainable community.

**We create a connected ecosystem of smart complexes with blockchain technology**.&#x20;

Our vision is to bring innovative solutions to the housing market, making life easier and more comfortable for our residents, and allowing them to optimize their time and focus on the things that matter most to them. We believe that blockchain technology is the key to achieving this goal. By leveraging the power of smart contracts, we are able to automate many of the processes involved in property management, rental/buying agreements, and safe transactions, without the need for intermediaries. This not only reduces the likelihood of errors but also creates a more efficient and streamlined system for everyone involved. Our decentralized environment ensures that all suitable blockchain processes are included, allowing our community members to generate additional income that can be transformed into passive income in the long term. We are building a tangible asset that guarantees the security of ownership, combined with the intangible blockchain technology that records and stores relevant data on a decentralized network of computers that cannot be altered or manipulated.

In the initial stage, our ecosystem will consist of a pilot project built in Georgia, with co-shared ownership among our members. Our community management system and renting application will amplify the passive income opportunities, providing our residents with a truly unique and rewarding living experience.
