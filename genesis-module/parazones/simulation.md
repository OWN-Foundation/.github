# Simulation

Digital twins are digital representations of physical objects or systems. In the case of a digital twin building, it would be a complete digital replica of a physical building.

To explain it in more detail, imagine standing in front of a tall building. You can see the exterior of the building, but you have no idea what the interior looks like. Now, imagine a digital twin of that building existing simultaneously in the digital world.

This digital twin would allow you to "walk" through the building virtually and experience the interior as if you were physically there. You could explore the different rooms, see the furniture, and get a sense of the layout.

On the other side, the physical building can also be integrated with the digital twin through sensors and other IoT devices. This would allow the digital twin to update in real-time with changes made to the physical building, providing a constantly updated and accurate representation.

The combination of the physical and digital world creates a powerful tool for architects, engineers, builders, and real estate professionals. It can help with everything from design and construction to maintenance and sustainability.&#x20;

The possibilities are endless.
