# Security Audits

The security of OWN is highest priority beginning at the time of its initial deployment, but still users should investigate risks involved with OWN before engaging with it. We are constantly working on security improvements:

* Using of OWNER's for governance decisions & to manage risk factors.
* Having multiple audits finished (see more).
* Having a committee of elected, best-in-class modules to minimize risk.
* Allowing staking across multiple modules&#x20;
* Using of non-custodial staking service to eliminate counterparty risk.

In the scorecard you may find an outlined set of attributes that we think are important for the decentralization of the protocol, and how OWN is faring against these targets.

> 📝 As for now, scorecard has only Ethereum related content. More chains to be added soon
