# OWN | Problem

The current financial system is heavily centralized, with a few large institutions holding a disproportionate amount of power and control. This can lead to a number of problems, such as:

* Limited access to financial services for certain groups: Many people, especially those in developing countries, do not have access to traditional financial services like banks or credit cards. This can make it difficult for them to participate in the global economy, and to take advantage of opportunities for growth and development.
* High fees and other barriers to participation: Traditional financial systems can be expensive to use, with high fees for things like transactions, international payments and currency exchange. This can make it difficult for people to afford to participate, and it can also discourage innovation and competition.
* Lack of transparency and accountability: Centralized financial systems can be opaque, with little visibility into how they operate or how decisions are made. This can lead to a lack of trust and confidence in the system, and it can also make it harder for people to hold institutions accountable for their actions.

The cryptocurrency and decentralized platform industry is a rapidly evolving and complex space, with numerous challenges and complexities. Some of the main complexities of the industry include:

1. **Regulation:** Cryptocurrencies and decentralized platforms operate in a largely unregulated environment, which can create uncertainty for users and make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities. This lack of regulation also makes it difficult to protect against fraud or other types of misconduct.
2. **Volatility:** Cryptocurrencies are known for their high level of price volatility, which can make it difficult for users to accurately assess the value of their investments. This volatility can also make it difficult for users to plan for the long-term, as they may not be able to predict the value of their assets.
3. **Security:** Cryptocurrencies and decentralized platforms are vulnerable to hacks and other types of cyber attacks, which can lead to the loss of users' assets. In addition, there have been instances of fraud and other types of misconduct within the industry, which can erode users' trust and confidence.
4. **Complexity:** Cryptocurrencies and decentralized platforms can be complex and difficult for users to understand, especially for those who are not familiar with the technology. This complexity can make it difficult for users to make informed decisions about their investments, and it can also be a barrier to entry for new users.
5. **Limited adoption:** Despite the growth of the cryptocurrency and decentralized platform industry, adoption of these technologies is still relatively limited, especially among mainstream users. This limited adoption can make it difficult for users to find others who are using the same platforms, and it can also limit the types of goods and services that are available on these platforms.
