**Preface**

Every day we interact with technologies controlled by a handful of large companies whose interests and incentives often conflicts with our own.&#x20;

If we want the benefits of using their proprietary apps, we're forced to agree to terms that most of us will never read, granting this companies complete control over the data we generate through each interaction with their tools.

Because that data can often paint a detailed picture of our personal lives, it's become a resource more valuable than oil. And we're giving it up for free -- with no choice but to trust that it won't be lost, stolen or misused.

At the same time, progress in open-source and decentralized technologies like blockchain has shown that we can build systems that prioritize individual sovereignty over centralized control. With these new systems, there's no need to trust any third parties not to be evil.

But blockchain technology, in its current form, isn't ready to break the corporate stranglehold on the web just yet. Despite the promise and the progress made, we have yet to see significant real-world deployment of the technology.
