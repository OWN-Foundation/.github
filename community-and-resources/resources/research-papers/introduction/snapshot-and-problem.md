# Snapshot & Problem

Snapshot:

The global DeFi market has been experiencing tremendous growth, with an increasing demand for decentralized and transparent financial services. As the traditional financial sector continues to face challenges in offering personalized and flexible solutions, the need for innovative platforms like the OWN Foundation becomes more evident.

Financial service providers are adopting digitalization and automation to develop greater productivity, while social media platforms emerge as major influencers and effective marketing channels. Meanwhile, blockchain and smart contracts are revolutionizing how financial transactions are conducted and recorded, paving the way for new market entrants.

North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific have all shown significant interest in decentralized finance, with each region contributing to the growth of the DeFi market. Factors such as increasing demand for CRM solutions across different industries, adoption of mobile technology, and advancements in the travel sector are all responsible for the growth in these markets.

The Problem:

Lack of personalization and transparency in traditional finance In the traditional financial sector, users often face limited choices and value. Large financial institutions and centralized systems tend to control access to financial services, forcing users to play by their rules. This often results in users not receiving the personalized financial services they need, giving them only the illusion of choice.

Cracks in the traditional financial system have started to appear as users seek more personalized and flexible financial solutions. The rise of DeFi and open-source decentralized funds, like the OWN Foundation, demonstrate that users are ready to migrate to platforms that empower them with more control and transparency in managing their finances.

With promising growth in the DeFi market, it's time for a disruption in the financial sector. The OWN Foundation, with its innovative approach to decentralized finance and integration of AI-driven services, is poised to meet the growing demand for personalized, transparent, and accessible financial services.
