# ├── Bug Bounties Grant/

OWN Bug Bounty programs allow you to report a vulnerability and get up to $2,000,000.

We’re using the Immunefi platform — the leading bug bounty platform for DeFi with the world's largest bounties.

Bug Bounty programs focused on the prevention of loss of user funds, denial of service, governance hijacks, data breaches, and data leaks.

We will have separate active programs for [Ethereum](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lido/), [Solana](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lidoforsolana/), [Polygon](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lidoonpolygon/), [Polkadot](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lidoonpolkadot/) and [Kusama](https://immunefi.com/bounty/lidoonkusama/).
