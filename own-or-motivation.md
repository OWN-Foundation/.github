# OWN | Motivation

While there are very real risks from this nascent technology and its uses, applications for the next generation of the internet continue to spring up in a growing number of industries with potentially transformative effects.

\
The financial-services industry has largely led the way in adopting some of these nascent digital technologies and assets—at its peak, the daily volume of transactions processed on so-called decentralized-finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion. Volume has since dropped to about $2 billion, largely in line with asset prices. Learnings from the financial-services experience—both the ups and the downs—are helping to inform usage in other sectors, which now include real estate, gaming, carbon markets, and art, among others.\


How far and how fast these technologies and their uses will spread remains to be seen; the journey is proving bumpy, with ongoing challenges ranging from poor user experience to fraud. Crucially, the regulatory picture for Web3 remains unsettled, with calls for greater clarity on some assets and more consumer protection for funds held in custody. Yet understanding the core features of this new digital wave and the potential disruption it could bring remains important for business leaders in a wide range of sectors.

The current state of the market is one of increasing centralization and consolidation, with a few large players dominating various industries. This concentration of power and control has resulted in a number of problems, including a lack of competition, reduced innovation, and the ability for these large players to abuse their position to the detriment of consumers and smaller businesses.

In addition, the current market is heavily reliant on centralized intermediaries, such as banks, payment processors, and social media platforms, to facilitate transactions and interactions. This reliance on intermediaries can lead to high fees, slow transaction times, and a lack of privacy.

Web3 technologies, which enable decentralized applications and protocols to be built on top of blockchain networks, offer a new way of doing business that is not reliant \


By leveraging web3 technologies, a company can create a decentralized platform that is transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship. This platform can be used to facilitate transactions, interactions, and exchange of value in a way that is more efficient, affordable, and private than current centralized solutions.

In summary, the current market is characterized by centralization, consolidation, and reliance on intermediaries, which has led to a number of problems. Web3 technologies offer a solution to these problems by enabling the creation of decentralized platforms that are more open, fair, and equitable
