# OWN | Governance

First generation networks such as Bitcoin largely avoided formal (or “on-chain”) governance mechanisms in favor of informal (or “off-chain”) mechanisms arising from a combination of role and incentive design. By most measures, Bitcoin’s governance mechanisms has been quite successful, allowing the protocol to grow dramatically in scale and value since its inception. However, there have also been some challenges. The economic concentration of Bitcoin has led to a concentration of political power. The result is that everyday people can get caught in the middle of destructive battles between massive holders of Bitcoin.

To build an enduring governance model **OWN | Governance** will pursue a two-phase plan.

#### **OWN |** Provisional Governance Model (< 5M Members)

Until the network hits a critical mass of 5M members, OWN will operate under a provisional governance model. This model will most closely resemble “off-chain” governance models currently employed by protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with **OWN | Team** playing an important role in guiding the development of the protocol. However, Team  will still rely heavily on the input of the community.

&#x20;The OWN | dApp itself is where core team has been soliciting community input and engaging with **OWNERS**.  embraces community critiques and suggestions, which is implemented by the open-for-comments features of landing page, FAQs and white paper.&#x20;

Whenever people browse these materials on **OWN | Platform**, they can submit comment on a specific section right there to ask for questions and make suggestions. Offline **OWNERS** meetups that **OWN | Team** have been organizing will also be an important channel for community input.\


Additionally, **OWN | Team** will develop more formal governance mechanics. One potential governance system is liquid democracy. In liquid democracy, every **OWNERS** will have the ability to either vote on an issue directly or to delegate their vote to another member of the network. Liquid democracy would allow for both broad and efficient membership from **OWNERS** .

#### **OWN |** “Constitutional Convention” (> 5M Members)

Upon hitting 5M members, a provisional committee will be formed based on previous contributions to the **OWN | Network**. This committee will be responsible for soliciting and proposing suggestions from and to the wider community.

&#x20;It will also organize a series of on- and offline conversations where **OWNERS** will be able to weigh on **OWN** long-term constitution. Given **OWN** global user base, the **OWN | Network** will conduct these conventions at multiple locations across the world to ensure accessibility.

&#x20;In addition to hosting in-person conventions, **OWN | Governance** will also use its mobile application as a platform for allowing **OWNERS** to participate in the process remotely. Whether in-person or online, **OWN** community members will have the ability to participate in the crafting long-term **OWN | Governance** structure.

Governance is an important aspect of any decentralized platform, including **OWN | Governance**. It refers to the way in which decisions are made, how power and control are exercised within the platform.
