# OWN | Governance

First generation networks such as Bitcoin largely avoided formal (or “on-chain”) governance mechanisms in favor of informal (or “off-chain”) mechanisms arising from a combination of role and incentive design. By most measures, Bitcoin’s governance mechanisms has been quite successful, allowing the protocol to grow dramatically in scale and value since its inception. However, there have also been some challenges. The economic concentration of Bitcoin has led to a concentration of political power. The result is that everyday people can get caught in the middle of destructive battles between massive holders of Bitcoin.

To build an enduring governance model **OWN | Governance** will pursue a two-phase plan.

#### **OWN |** Provisional Governance Model (< 5M Members)

Until the network hits a critical mass of 5M members, Pi will operate under a provisional governance model. This model will most closely resemble “off-chain” governance models currently employed by protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with **OWN | Core Team** playing an important role in guiding the development of the protocol. However, Core Team  will still rely heavily on the input of the community. The Pi mobile application itself is where core team has been soliciting community input and engaging with **OWNERS**.  embraces community critiques and suggestions, which is implemented by the open-for-comments features of landing page, FAQs and white paper. Whenever people browse these materials on **OWN | Platform**, they can submit comment on a specific section right there to ask for questions and make suggestions. Offline **OWNERS** meetups that **OWN | Core Team** have been organizing will also be an important channel for community input.\


Additionally, **OWN | Core Team** will develop more formal governance mechanics. One potential governance system is liquid democracy. In liquid democracy, every **OWNERS** will have the ability to either vote on an issue directly or to delegate their vote to another member of the network. Liquid democracy would allow for both broad and efficient membership from **OWNERS** community.

#### **OWN |** “Constitutional Convention” (> 5M Members)

Upon hitting 5M members, a provisional committee will be formed based on previous contributions to the **OWN | Network**. This committee will be responsible for soliciting and proposing suggestions from and to the wider community. It will also organize a series of on- and offline conversations where **OWNERS** will be able to weigh on **OWN** long-term constitution. Given **OWN** global user base, the **OWN | Network** will conduct these conventions at multiple locations across the world to ensure accessibility. In addition to hosting in-person conventions, **OWN | Governance** will also use its mobile application as a platform for allowing **OWNERS** to participate in the process remotely. Whether in-person or online, **OWN** community members will have the ability to participate in the crafting **** long-term **OWN | Governance** structure.

Governance is an important aspect of any decentralized platform, including **OWN | Governance**. It refers to the way in which decisions are made and how power and control are exercised within the platform.

There are several key considerations when it comes to the **OWN | Governance**

1. **Decentralization:** One of the main benefits of a decentralized platform is that it is operated by a distributed network of users, rather than a central authority. This means that power and control are distributed more evenly, and that everyone has the opportunity to participate and contribute to the platform.
2. **Voting:** One way in which the governance can be exercised is through voting. Users can vote on different proposals and decisions related to the platform, and the outcome of these votes can help shape the direction of the platform.
3. **Smart contracts:** Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. They can be used to automate processes and decision-making, and can help ensure that the governance is transparent and fair.
4. **Community input:** It is important for the governance to be open and inclusive, and to allow for input from the wider community. This can be achieved through forums, online discussions, and other forms of engagement.

Overall, **OWN | Governance** will be critical to platform success and sustainability. By carefully considering these and other factors, the foundation can create a governance model that is transparent, fair, and inclusive.
