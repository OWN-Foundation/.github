# Quick market figures

The market for cryptocurrency and decentralized platforms has grown significantly in recent years, and it is expected to continue to grow in the future. According to a report by CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies exceeded $1 trillion in 2021, and it is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2025.

The financial-services industry has largely led the way in adopting some of these nascent digital technologies and assets—at its peak, the daily volume of transactions processed on so-called decentralized-finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion. Volume has since dropped to about $2 billion, largely in line with asset prices. Learnings from the financial-services experience—both the ups and the downs—are helping to inform usage in other sectors, which now include real estate, gaming and art, among others.

**OWN | Foundation** is well positioned to capitalize on this growth, as it offers a unique and innovative platform that addresses many of the challenges and limitations of traditional financial systems. The platform's decentralized nature, smart contracts and inclusive investment opportunities make it attractive to users, including those who may be excluded from traditional financial systems.

In addition, the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts on **OWN | Platform** provides increased security and transparency, which is becoming increasingly important to users as concerns about fraud and data privacy continue to rise. This added level of trust and accountability is expected to drive further adoption of the platform.
