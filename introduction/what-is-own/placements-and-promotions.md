# Placements & Promotions

A variety of platform advertising and direct marketing opportunities will be made available to strategic partners who wish to leverage the extensive reach and user engagement offered through OWN Foundation. These partners can promote their projects, services and tools (modules) to the diverse community within the ecosystem.

Importantly, these partners will be vetted by the OWN Foundation team to ensure that they align with the platform's values and objectives.

Marketing opportunities vary in type and cost, ranging from the option to place relevant advertisements alongside user activities (such as project discovery, investment opportunities, etc.), to prioritizing listings for specific searches, to being able to directly communicate and make arrangements with the leading innovators, builders and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) on the platform.
