# Problem statement

Every day we interact with technologies controlled by a handful of large companies whose interests and incentives often conflicts with our own.&#x20;

If we want the benefits of using their proprietary apps, we're forced to agree to terms that most of us will never read, granting this companies complete control over the data we generate through each interaction with their tools.

Because that data can often paint a detailed picture of our personal lives, it's become a resource more valuable than oil. And we're giving it up for free -- with no choice but to trust that it won't be lost, stolen or misused.

At the same time, progress in open-source and decentralized technologies like blockchain has shown that we can build systems that prioritize individual sovereignty over centralized control. With these new systems, there's no need to trust any third parties not to be evil.

But blockchain technology, in its current form, isn't ready to break the corporate stranglehold on the web just yet. Despite the promise and the progress made, we have yet to see significant real-world deployment of the technology.

the current market is heavily reliant on centralized intermediaries, such as banks, payment processors, and social media platforms, to facilitate transactions and interactions. This concentration of power and control has resulted in a number of problems, including a lack of competition, reduced innovation and the ability for these large players to abuse their position to the detriment of consumers and smaller businesses.

Lack of accessibility and transparency in the traditional financial sector, users often face limited choices and values. Large financial institutions and centralized systems tend to control data and access to financial services, forcing users to play by their rules. This often results in users not receiving the financial services they need, giving them only the illusion of choice.
