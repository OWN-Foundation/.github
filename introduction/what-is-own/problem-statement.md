# Problem statement v1

Lack of accessibility and transparency in the traditional financial sector, users often face limited choices and values. Large financial institutions and centralized systems tend to control data and access to financial services, forcing users to play by their rules. This often results in users not receiving the financial services they need, giving them only the illusion of choice.

The challenges we are addressing

1. Limited accessibility
2. High fees
3. High deposit and asset prices
4. Limited Information
5. Lack of transparency
