description: Centralized power and resources

# Problem statement

The current market is heavily reliant on centralized intermediaries, such as banks, payment processors, and social media platforms, to facilitate transactions and interactions. This concentration of power and control has resulted in a number of problems, including a lack of competition, reduced innovation and the ability for these large players to abuse their position to the detriment of consumers and smaller businesses.

Lack of accessibility and transparency in the traditional financial sector, users often face limited choices and values. Large financial institutions and centralized systems tend to control data and access to financial services, forcing users to play by their rules. This often results in users not receiving the financial services they need, giving them only the illusion of choice.

The challenges we are addressing

1. Limited accessibility
2. High fees
3. High deposit and asset prices
4. Limited Information
5. Lack of transparency
6. The traditional model of housing ( lack of IOT, smart usage)

Lack of investment opportunities in crypto for real estate

* The limited accessibility of real estate investment opportunities has resulted in the exclusion of many potential investors who lack the necessary financial resources or networking connections.&#x20;
* Real estate investment is often associated with high fees that can deter potential investors, as the costs can quickly add up and reduce the return on investment. These fees can be attributed to several factors, including third-party services that are often required to complete transactions.&#x20;
* The lack of transparency in the real estate industry can create several problems for buyers. Hidden costs, limited information, difficulty in negotiating, legal issues and the risk of fraud are all possible consequences. These issues can add up quickly, creating financial difficulties and legal problems for buyers. Moreover, the fear of these potential issues can discourage people from joining the real estate market, making it harder for both buyers and sellers to make transactions.
* The traditional model of housing may not be problematic but it may not offer the same level of efficiency, convenience and security as a smart home equipped with AI and IoT technology. Smart homes are designed to offer automation and connectivity, resulting in time and energy savings for homeowners. They are also more energy-efficient, thanks to sensors and algorithms that can monitor and control energy consumption.&#x20;
* The lack of investment opportunities in real estate in crypto can be attributed to limited acceptance, lack of regulation, volatility, infrastructure and limited availability. Many real estate developers and investors may not be familiar or comfortable with cryptocurrency and the unregulated nature of cryptocurrency markets can create uncertainty and risk for investors.&#x20;
