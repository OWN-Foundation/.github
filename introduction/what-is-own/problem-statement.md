# Problem statement

The current market is heavily reliant on centralized intermediaries, such as banks, payment processors, and social media platforms, to facilitate transactions and interactions. This concentration of power and control has resulted in a number of problems, including a lack of competition, reduced innovation and the ability for these large players to abuse their position to the detriment of consumers and smaller businesses.

Lack of accessibility and transparency in the traditional financial sector, users often face limited choices and values. Large financial institutions and centralized systems tend to control data and access to financial services, forcing users to play by their rules. This often results in users not receiving the financial services they need, giving them only the illusion of choice.
