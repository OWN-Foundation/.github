# What is OWN

THE OWN FOUNDATION or simply OWN is a decentralized public fund, designed to operates without a central authority, providing a simple and secure way to invest, save or exchange value.

Our platform provides a community-driven approach to fund management, where innovators, investors, builders, entrepreneurs and other community members can create modules that provide valuable assets, goods or services, all while earning rewards in the form of own token. With OWN, we're building a new ecosystem that is shared, self-sustainable, secure and transparent

OWN's design offers several distinc advantages over existing methods, including investments, savings and earnings also...

* **OWN .** The heart of OWN FOUNDATION, responsible for the security of fund, consensus and rewards.
* **Modules**. Sovereign contracts that can have their own tokens and optimize their functionality for specific use cases. To connect the Core, modules can pay as they go or lease a slot for continuous connectivity.
* **Module Provider**. entities that manage a secure and stable infrastructure for running module clients for the benefit of the protocols. They‚Äôre professional providers who can ensure the safety of funds belonging to the protocol users and correctness of operations.
* **Artifact NFTs** . The tokens backed by physical assets of real estate. Special tokens that represent peace of building. allow to connect and communicate between digital and physical worlds. external networks like Ethereum and Polkadot.

üìù Modules on different networks inherit the architecture of their respective networks. This means that the designs of OWN tokens can vary significantly. Also different modules are maintained by different dev teams. If you are interested in launching OWN on another network please submit your proposal on the research forum.

* `own[token]`. Unlike staked tokens, the own`[token]` are freely transferable instead of locked as in the case of native staking. OWN lets users operate with staked tokens by leveraging collateral, lending, farming and other kinds of DeFi protocols.
* **OWN Governance:** By allowing users to participate in the decision-making process through own governance mechanism.

üìù To dive into the details of governance design and implementation, proceed to OWN.

&#x20;Currently OWN supports several networks - when staking native tokens with OWN, users will receive a `own[token]`, which represents their `[token]` which represents their deposit and the rewards aggregated over time (penalties too). The following networks are supported:&#x20;

* **Ethereum**
* **Polygon**
