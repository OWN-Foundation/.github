# What is OWN

THE OWN FOUNDATION or simply OWN is a decentralized public fund designed to operates without a central authority, providing a simple and secure way to invest, save or exchange value.

&#x20; OWN tokens can be used across a range of modules, protocols and DeFi applications, to getting extra rewards.

* **Modules**. entities that manage a secure and stable infrastructure for running module clients for the benefit of the protocols. They‚Äôre professional providers who can ensure the safety of funds belonging to the protocol users and correctness of operations.
* **Module Operators**. entities that manage a secure and stable infrastructure for running module clients for the benefit of the protocols. They‚Äôre professional providers who can ensure the safety of funds belonging to the protocol users and correctness of operations.

üìù Modules on different networks inherit the architecture of their respective networks. This means that the designs of OWN tokens can vary significantly. Also different modules are maintained by different dev teams. If you are interested in launching OWN on another network please submit your proposal on the research forum.

* `own[token]`. Unlike staked tokens, the own`[token]` are freely transferable instead of locked as in the case of native staking. OWN lets users operate with staked tokens by leveraging collateral, lending, farming and other kinds of DeFi protocols.
* **Decentralized governance:** By allowing users to participate in the decision-making process through decentralized governance.

üìù To dive into the details of governance design and implementation, proceed to OWN.

&#x20;Currently OWN supports several networks - when staking native tokens with OWN, users will receive a `own[token]`, which represents their `[token]` which represents their deposit and the rewards aggregated over time (penalties too). The following networks are supported:&#x20;

* **Ethereum**
* **Polygon**
