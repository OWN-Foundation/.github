# Quick market figures

The market for cryptocurrency and decentralized platforms has grown significantly in recent years, and it is expected to continue to grow in the future. According to a report by CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies exceeded $1 trillion in 2021, and it is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2025.

The financial-services industry has largely led the way in adopting some of these nascent digital technologies and assets—at its peak, the daily volume of transactions processed on so-called decentralized-finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion. Volume has since dropped to about $2 billion, largely in line with asset prices. Learnings from the financial-services experience—both the ups and the downs—are helping to inform usage in other sectors, which now include real estate, gaming and art, among others.

OWN Foundation aims to gain widespread adoption primarily among younger generations, such as Gen-Z and the youngest representatives of Gen-X (Millennials). These digital natives are well-versed in innovative technologies, including blockchain and decentralized finance. The 21-31 age group is estimated to have over $300 billion in disposable income, making them a prime target for the foundation.

OWN Foundation plans to offer everything this demographic values the most:

* User-friendly interface and mobile accessibility.
* Decentralized, transparent, and community-driven approach to investments.
* Opportunities to create and participate in various projects and initiatives.
* Chatbot for the best-in-class user experience and support.

OWN Foundation estimates that the target addressable market (TAM) for its platform among the 21-31 age group is approximately $12 billion. The foundation aims to capture a 2% market share by 2024. To achieve this, OWN Foundation will need to reach the following milestones:

Focusing on tech-savvy individuals who are open to innovation, OWN Foundation can achieve greater efficiency in user acquisition and increase the customer lifetime value (CLV) for those who join the platform. While the primary focus is on younger demographics, OWN Foundation is an inclusive platform that welcomes participation from people of all ages and backgrounds.
