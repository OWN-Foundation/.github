# Solution

OWN Foundation is dedicated to combine cutting-edge technologies, pooling our power and resource in one platform, empower and motivate users from over the world to come and create more equitable future worldwide.

* **OWN** responsible for the security of fund, consensus and rewards.
* **Core Platform -** Contains default modules such is Portal, Staking, Wallet , Treasury and AI bot ( ownGPT ) features and tools.
* **Modules -** Sovereign contracts that can have their own tokens and optimize their functionality for specific use cases. To connect the Core, modules can pay as they go or lease a slot for continuous connectivity.
* **OWN Governance:** By allowing users to participate in the decision-making process through own governance mechanism.

üìù To dive into the details of governance design and implementation, proceed to OWN Governance.

üìù Modules on different networks inherit the architecture of their respective networks. This means that the designs of OWN tokens can vary significantly. Also different modules are maintained by different dev teams. If you are interested in launching OWN on another network please submit your proposal on the research forum.
