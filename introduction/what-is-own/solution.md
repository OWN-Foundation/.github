The financial-services industry has largely led the way in adopting some of these nascent digital technologies and assets—at its peak, the daily volume of transactions processed on so-called decentralized-finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion. Volume has since dropped to about $2 billion, largely in line with asset prices. Learnings from the financial-services experience—both the ups and the downs—are helping to inform usage in other sectors, which now include real estate, gaming and art, among others.

As the demand for decentralized financial grows, users increasingly expect tailored solutions that cater to their unique needs and preferences. People value a unique experience that offers accessibility, transparency and more control, whether they're managing their finances for personal or business purposes. Transparency has become a top priority in financial services and consumers are ready to migrate to platforms that empower a customized approach.&#x20;
