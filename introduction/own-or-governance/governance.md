To have a vote in the OWN FOUNDATION, and to contribute to the determination of any of the topics outlined above, one must hold the `OWN`governance token. Holding own`token`gives members a vote in the future of OWN, allowing each member to have a personal say in the community. `OWN`voting weight is proportional to the amount of `OWN`a voter holds. The more OWN on a user’s address, the greater the decision-making power the voter gets. The exact mechanism of `OWN`voting can be upgraded just like the other DAO applications.
