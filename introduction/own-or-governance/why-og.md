### Why OWN Governance?[â€‹](https://docs.lido.fi/lido-dao#why-dao) ( OG ) <a href="#why-dao" id="why-dao"></a>

The OWN FOUNDATION governed by its users ( owners ) who manages the core fund protocol by deciding on key parameters (e.g., setting fees, assigning modules and module operators, oracles, etc.) through the voting power of governance token (`OWN`) holders. Also, the own token holders (owners) will accumulate service fees and spend them on research, development, staking incentives and protocol or module upgrades.

There are several key considerations when it comes to the **OWN | Governance**

1. **Decentralization:** One of the main benefits of a decentralized platform is that it is operated by a distributed network of users, rather than a central authority. This means that power and control are distributed more evenly and that everyone has the opportunity to participate and contribute to the platform.
2. **Voting:** One way in which the governance can be exercised is through voting. Users can vote on different proposals and decisions related to the platform, and the outcome of these votes can help shape the direction of the platform.
3. **Smart contracts:** Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. They can be used to automate processes and decision-making, and can help ensure that the governance is transparent and fair.
4. **Community input:** It is important for the governance to be open and inclusive, and to allow for input from the wider community. This can be achieved through forums, online discussions, and other forms of engagement.

Overall, **OWN | Governance** will be critical to platform success and sustainability. By carefully considering these and other factors, the foundation creates a governance model that is transparent, fair and inclusive.

The OWN Governance will accumulate service fees from Modules, which is locked in treasury into the insurance and development funds.
