# Testnet

#### Launching - Beta 0.1v

**Development of core platform functionality:** This will likely involve building the infrastructure for the platform, including the blockchain, smart contract functionality, and any other key features that are necessary for the platform to function.

**Onboarding of users and developers:** Once the core platform is built, the next step will be to attract users and developers to the platform. This could involve marketing campaigns, partnerships with other organizations, or other efforts to build a community around the platform.

**Implementation of governance models:** As the platform grows, it will be important to establish clear governance structures and decision-making processes to ensure that the platform remains decentralized and transparent. This could involve the development of voting mechanisms, the creation of a governance council, or other mechanisms for ensuring that all stakeholders have a say in the direction of the platform.
