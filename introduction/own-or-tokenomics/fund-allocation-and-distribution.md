# Fund allocation & distribution

The OWN Token is designed to incentivize and reward participants who actively contribute to the OWN Foundation ecosystem. With a fixed supply cap of 10 billion tokens. Within the ecosystem, OWN Tokens will be used to reward creators, builders, investors, and community members who develop artifacts, modules, and tools. Participants can trade the token on supported exchanges or use it to access goods and services within the platform. To make our token sale model accessible to all community members and investors, regardless of their investment level, we plan to conduct a genesis presale and before public sale the official launch. Early supporters will have the opportunity to invest in our project at discounted rates, fostering a more inclusive and diverse ecosystem. This structure allows early supporters to benefit from discounted rates while ensuring a wide distribution of tokens during the public sale.

The Genesis Sale - will target early supporters and investors who believe in the potential of the OWN Foundation. This sale will offer a limited number of tokens at a discounted rate, incentivizing early participation and fostering a strong initial community.

Token Allocation for Genesis Sale:

* 10% (1 billion tokens) of the total supply will be allocated for the Genesis Sale
* Discounted rate: Tokens in the Genesis Sale will be offered at a lower price compared to the Public Sale
* Vesting period: A vesting period may apply to Genesis Sale participants, ensuring long-term commitment to the project

The Public Sale - will be open to the broader public and aims to distribute the majority of the remaining tokens. This sale will ensure that a diverse group of participants can join the OWN Foundation ecosystem, further strengthening its growth and development.

Token Allocation for Public Sale:

* 30% (3 billion tokens) of the total supply will be allocated for the Public Sale
* Fixed rate: Tokens in the Public Sale will be offered at a predetermined price
* No vesting period: Tokens purchased during the Public Sale will be immediately available for use and trading

Token Distribution - The 10 billion OWN Tokens will be distributed as follows:

* 10% (1 billion tokens) for the Genesis Sale
* 5% (500 million tokens) for liquidity and exchange listings
* 30% (3 billion tokens) locked for the module grants in Foundation Treasury
* 40% (4 billion tokens) for the community rewards and incentive locked in Foundation Treasury
* 15% (1.5 billion tokens) for teams and advisors

This token distribution model ensures a diverse and inclusive ecosystem within the OWN Foundation, enabling its continued growth and success.
