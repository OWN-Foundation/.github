# OWN | Roadmap

The roadmap for **OWN | Foundation** will depend on the specific goals and objectives of the platform. However, there are a few key milestones that are likely to be included on any roadmap for a decentralized platform like this one. Some potential milestones might include:

1. **Development of core platform functionality:** This will likely involve building the infrastructure for the platform, including the blockchain, smart contract functionality, and any other key features that are necessary for the platform to function.
2. **Onboarding of users and developers:** Once the core platform is built, the next step will be to attract users and developers to the platform. This could involve marketing campaigns, partnerships with other organizations, or other efforts to build a community around the platform.
3. **Expansion of project offerings**: As the platform grows and attracts more users, it will be important to continue expanding the range of projects that are available on the platform. This could include new types of projects, such as social initiatives or creative endeavors, or it could involve expanding the platform to new geographic regions or sectors.
4. **Implementation of governance models:** As the platform grows, it will be important to establish clear governance structures and decision-making processes to ensure that the platform remains decentralized and transparent. This could involve the development of voting mechanisms, the creation of a governance council, or other mechanisms for ensuring that all stakeholders have a say in the direction of the platform.
5. **Integration with other platforms and systems:** As the platform matures, it may be necessary to integrate with other platforms or systems in order to expand its reach and impact. This could involve partnerships with other organizations, integration with existing financial systems, or other efforts to connect the platform to a wider ecosystem.
